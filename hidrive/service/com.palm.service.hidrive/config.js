/* config.js - STRATO HiDrive OAuth2 + REST 2.1 endpoints for the modern connector.
 *
 * HiDrive is PATH-BASED like Yandex/Dropbox: a resource is addressed by an absolute path under
 * the account home ("/users/<user>/Folder/file.docx"). This connector mirrors the Yandex one
 * with HiDrive's identity platform and its home-path convention bolted on. Every API call sends
 * "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" and shells through the modern curl (device node 0.9.8k).
 *
 * REGISTER a native app at https://developer.hidrive.com/get-api-key/ (app type "native" -> you
 * get a client_secret AND refresh tokens; there is NO PKCE, so the secret ships in the package,
 * the same situation as the pCloud/Google connectors). Set the redirect URI to REDIRECT_URI
 * below. Request scope "user,rw". Paste the Client ID + Client secret into CLIENT_ID/SECRET.
