 * The stock Photos aggregator (com.palm.service.photos) treats this service as a
 * cloud photo provider: it calls listAlbums/listPhotos, then downloads the bytes to
 * local storage itself (see the curl patch in that service's Sync-Manager.js). The
 * account template's PHOTO.UPLOAD capabilityProvider + the templateId->serviceName
 * switch in the aggregator's Utils.js route "com.palm.dropbox" here.
 *
 * Per the user's choice, ONE Dropbox folder is surfaced as ONE album (default
 * "/Camera Uploads") to bound how much gets auto-downloaded into /media/internal.
 * To point at a different folder, change ALBUM_PATH/ALBUM_NAME below.
