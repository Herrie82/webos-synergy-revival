// Bridges mediaserver's local SkypeKit RTP sockets (the /tmp/vidrtp_{to,from}_skypekit_key
// abstract Unix sockets — see messaging/whatsapp/calling/WHATSAPP_VIDEO_STATUS.md Parts 10-18)
// to libtgvoip's VoIPController, via the VoipKitVideoSource/VoipKitVideoRenderer adapters in
// voipkit-tgvoip.cpp. Called from call-luna.cpp's callLunaOpenClonk/callLunaCloseClonk (see
// that file for the LS2 videoCaptureStart/videoPlayerStart sequencing this depends on).
//
// Adapted from messaging/facebook-e2ee/plugin/purple-combined/glue/skypekit.h — the only
// difference from that version is that Thread A's decoded access units are delivered via a
// settable callback here instead of a hardcoded Go export (this plugin is pure C++, no cgo).

// not a hard requirement). Call this AFTER voipkit_video_start() and BEFORE videoPlayerStart:
// unlike Thread A's near-instant bind+listen, Thread B must wait for Thread A to already be
