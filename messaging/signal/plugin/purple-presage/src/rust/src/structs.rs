// std reader thread can enqueue SendCallAnswer/SendCallIce -- and a static Sender<Cmd> requires
// Cmd: Send. The raw pointers in the Send/GetAttachment variants are only ever dereferenced on the
// main/runtime thread (append_message etc.); the call-bridge variants carry only Send data. This
// unsafe impl formalises the thread movement that already happens.
