/* config.js - Mega (mega.nz) endpoints + wiring for the modern connector.
 *
 * Mega is the ODD ONE OUT among the connectors: it is NOT OAuth2 and NOT a plaintext REST
 * API. It is a zero-knowledge, end-to-end-encrypted store. There is a single JSON command
 * endpoint (the "cs" API) at https://g.api.mega.co.nz/cs to which we POST a JSON array of
 * commands and read back a JSON array of results. Everything else - the login handshake and
 * all file/attribute crypto - happens client-side in megacrypto.js. See adapter.js/megaapi.js.
 *
 * There is NOTHING to register and NO client id/secret: the account owner signs in with their
 * OWN Mega email + password (the mega-auth app collects them, the `login` command runs the
 * us0/us handshake). So the identical package ships to every device, same as the PKCE ones.
