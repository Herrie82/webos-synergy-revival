/* config.js - Flickr OAuth 1.0a + REST API endpoints.
 *
 * SCAFFOLD: register a (free) app at https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/
 * to obtain an API KEY (= CONSUMER_KEY) and its matching SECRET (= CONSUMER_SECRET).
 * Flickr signs with OAuth 1.0a / HMAC-SHA1, so - unlike a modern OAuth2 PKCE public
 * client - the consumer SECRET is genuinely required to sign every request. It is a
 * placeholder below and MUST be filled in before this connector will authenticate.
 *
 * Flickr is a PHOTO source only (browse + download into the stock Photos app). There
 * is no documents/files role here, so read=only "read" perms are requested.
