/* config.js - Google Drive (Drive API v3) OAuth2 + REST endpoints for the modern
 * connector. DOCUMENTS-only: Google Photos is NOT reachable headlessly (see
 * ../../recon/google-drive.md), so there is no PHOTO.UPLOAD provider here.
 *
 * IMPORTANT - this is a PERSONAL / <=100-user, UNVERIFIED build by necessity:
 *   - Browsing arbitrary Drive folders needs the RESTRICTED `drive` scope. An unverified
 *     app shows a "this app hasn't been verified" screen and is capped at 100 users for
 *     life. Public distribution would need Google's CASA/app verification.
 *   - Google's "Desktop app" client type STILL requires a client_secret on the token
 *     exchange (it treats it as non-confidential). So unlike Dropbox/Box/OneDrive this
 *     connector DOES ship a secret. Keep PKCE on too (Desktop supports both).
 *   - Keep the OAuth consent screen "In production" (NOT "Testing") or external refresh
 *     tokens are revoked every 7 days.
 *
 * REGISTER at https://console.cloud.google.com/ -> OAuth consent screen (External, In
 * production) + Credentials -> OAuth client ID -> "Desktop app". Add scope .../auth/drive
 * and the redirect URI below. Paste BOTH CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET.
